      <h1>Footwear That Anchors the Fit: 4 Dark Looks</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Not every outfit needs a loud top layer. Sometimes it's the shoes that
        lock everything in place. The silhouette, the texture, even the polish —
        the right pair can shift the entire vibe. Here are four pairs I wear
        regularly, each styled to keep the overall look grounded, minimal, and
        intentional.

          />
        </div>

        <p>
          I wear a pair from <strong>George Cox</strong>, a classic UK brand
          known for its deep roots in punk and mod culture. The chunky sole and
          woven leather up front give these creepers a distinct structure that
          works especially well with cropped trousers and bold socks — here, a
          muted red for contrast.
        </p>

        <p>
          They’re definitely a standout, but still feel balanced when the rest
          of the look is toned down.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Style Tip:</strong> Keep the palette tight. When the shoes do
          the work, everything else can stay minimal.
        </p>

        <p>
          The high-top version in classic black is a staple. It’s casual, easy,
          and leans post-punk when paired with slim pants and boxy outerwear.
          What I like most is how beat-up pairs age well. They carry the marks
          of the wearer — just like a good leather jacket.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Style Tip:</strong> Show some sock or stack your pants
          slightly at the ankle to create tension between structure and slouch.

          The all-black monochrome version keeps things sharp and tonal. These
          are my go-to when I want a heavier base under tailored or layered
          fits. I wear them when I need the outfit to feel more grounded —
          literally and stylistically.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Style Tip:</strong> Polish them up if the rest of the fit is
          rough. Leave them beat-up if everything else is clean.

        <p>
          These feel like a curveball at first — until you try them with cuffed
          black trousers and minimal layers. The burgundy tone gives just enough
          depth without getting loud. They feel formal and punk at the same
          time, which is hard to pull off — but Solovair nailed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Style Tip:</strong> Use the color as your pop. Keep the rest
          matte, dark, and clean.

          Each of these pairs brings something different — weight, contrast,
          texture — but they all fit within a dark, minimalist framework. When
          you build your wardrobe with intention, the shoes don’t just finish
          the look — they define it.
