        <h2>The Best Socks Iâ€™ve Found for Creepers, Loafers, and Boots</h2>
        <p>
         This lineup is stripped down to the essentials: brogues, loafers, creepers. 
         The socks here are the ones I trust to sharpen the look.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isnâ€™t about bright colors or ironic patterns. Itâ€™s about subtle
          shifts â€” weight, length, texture â€” that either sharpen a look or sink
          it. These are the socks I actually wear, and why they work.

        <h3>1. Ribbed white socks</h3>

        <p>
         These thick, off-white socks add a deliberate contrast to the deep oxblood brogues and pinstripe trousers, giving the outfit a clean, utilitarian edge. 
         The color breaks up the darkness of the look without clashing â€” it feels intentional, not flashy. Their visible texture and heft make the outfit feel more grounded and styled, 
         adding to the post-punk workwear vibe without overdoing it. Itâ€™s the kind of subtle statement that makes the whole look feel considered.

        <h3>2. Ribbed Red Socks</h3>

          loading="lazy"
        />
        <p>
        The red socks cut through the dark palette with a bold, rebellious edge. Paired with creepers and cuffed pants, they add a sharp jolt of color that feels deliberate and punk without trying too hard.

        <h3>3. Burgundy Socks</h3>

        <p>
          Color â€” but only barely. Burgundy is my go-to when everything else Iâ€™m
          wearing is black. It adds warmth without ruining the mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why I wear them:</strong> Theyâ€™re a quiet contrast. You notice
          them if youâ€™re paying attention.

        <h3>ðŸ§¼ Final tip: Extra Thick Socks</h3>
        <p>
         Hard shoes need soft reinforcements. Fox Riverâ€™s thick socks are my buffer against the break-in period (and loose fits).
