          Black Thread Club is about staying intentional — darker palettes,
          clean silhouettes, and timeless pieces that feel personal, not
          performative. I'm Jesse. I live in Brooklyn and grew up playing in
          heavy metal bands before falling in love with post-punk, new wave, and
          the style that came with it. I’m a longtime MMA fan and a former
          Brazilian Jiu Jitsu instructor. These days, I drink matcha in the
          morning and build my wardrobe around thrifted finds and pieces that
          balance budget, comfort, and edge. This site is where I document what
          I actually wear — modern essentials with a darker aesthetic,
          influenced by music, street style, and a sense of self.
