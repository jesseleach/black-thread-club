          Black Thread Club is about staying intentional. Dark palettes, clean
          silhouettes, and a style that’s less about trends and more about
          knowing what makes me feel comfortable and classic. I live in Bushwick
          and work in finance. I grew up playing in heavy metal bands and later
          landed in post-punk and new wave. I'm also a former brazilian jiu
          jitsu instructor and MMA fan. These days, I drink matcha in the
          morning and build my wardrobe around thrifted finds and pieces that
          hit that sweet spot between budget and style. This is where I share
          what I actually wear — no fluff, no filler, just modern essentials
          with a darker edge.
